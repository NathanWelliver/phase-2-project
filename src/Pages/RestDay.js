            <h1>Remember To Take a Rest!</h1>
            <h4>
                Rest days are important! You may not realize that, or want to continue to work out 
                even if you already did you workouts for the week or beginning of the week.
                but if you dont rest your body cant recover fully. Remember, Keys to proper recovery
                after any good workout is rest or sleep, food, and some extra activities that you 
                normally wouldn't think would help. But ice baths can help muscle's recover faster.
                Don't over train! Your body has limits, try to stay in them to help prevent injury's.
            </h4>
            <h5>
            You should also stay hydrated after a workout. The American College of Sports
            Medicine recommends drinking 16 to 24 ounces of water 2 to 3 hours before
            working out, 4 to 8 ounces every 15 to 20 minutes during your workout, and 16 to 24
            ounces for every pound of fluid you lose after your workout. If you're
            exercising for more than 60 minutes, you can also try a sports drink with
            electrolytes and carbohydrates to replenish what your body has used. 
            </h5>
