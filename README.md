# Description
This project is designed to help people who are new to working out and need guidance to get started, as well as for those looking to create a good weekly workout plan.

When you first enter the website, you are greeted on the home page with today's date. Depending on the day of the week, it will recommend a part of the body to focus your workout on. Below that, it will suggest a random workout for that specific body part.

# About Page
The About page contains all of the workouts in our database. If there is a workout that you don't see on our page, you are welcome to add it! There is a form at the top of the page that allows you to do so. The workout form will ask for the name of the workout, the number of sets and reps, and the part of the body that this workout targets.

# Rest Page
The Rest page is one of my favorites. Even some of the most experienced lifters sometimes forget the importance of rest days. This page is dedicated to informing everyone about a rest day's importance for healing the body and recovering. You can't make progress if you don't let your body and mind heal!
